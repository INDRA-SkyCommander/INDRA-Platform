### Dev Notes

#### Package dependencies
At the end of your development session, before pushing your changes, update dependencies if any additional requirements are added. In further iterations a bash script will be supplied to install these requirements.

#### GUI
* TKinter is being used to create the GUI, but TKinter looks very outdated. As a simple workaround for this, a theme is being used to easily update the look of the GUI. 
* This means your should use "ttk()" instead of "tk()" in most places.
* Example: 
```py
top_box = ttk.Frame(root, padding=(3, 3, 12, 12), style="box.TFrame")
```

#### VIRTUALBOX SETUP

2. Select USB and specify USB Controller.

3. Select either USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller or USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller according to your actual hardware.

4. Add USB Device Filters to define the types of USB drives which will be automatically made visible to the guest OS.

5. Start up VirtualBox, right-click on the virtual machine that needs access to a USB device, and click Settings.

6. In the virtual machineâ€™s Setting tab, click on USB to see the available USB devices.

7. Click on the + sign to add a new device. This device should read either Realtek 802.11 NIC, RTL 8812, or equivalent

8. Once USB device added, start up the virtual machine to have access to the data on the USB device.
